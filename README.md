# Sign Quality Detector

## Overview
Sign Quality Detector is a web application that uses a machine learning model to classify Signs as either **Good** or **Spoiled**. This project demonstrates how TensorFlow and Keras can be used to build and deploy a Sign classification system on Streamlit.

## Hosted App
The application is live and hosted at:
[https://Sign-classify.onrender.com/](https://Sign-classify.onrender.com/)

## Key Learning
To successfully deploy this app on Streamlit, use TensorFlow and Keras version **2.15.0**.

## Features
- Upload an image of a Sign to classify its quality.
- Sidebar with sample images of both good and spoiled Signs.
- Intuitive and responsive user interface built using Streamlit.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Languages**: Python
